# Topic 3: The right to know how your data is used

&nbsp;

You have the right to know how your personal data is gathered and processed. Any legal organisation collecting your data is a controller. 

&nbsp;

**When a controller is in possession of your personal data, it must inform you of:**

- the legal identity of the controller
- the reason why your personal data is necessary
- for how long your personal data will be necessary
- whether your personal data will be disclosed to other parties and
- how you can exercise your rights with regard to your personal data.
 
 &nbsp;
 
The controller will normally provide these details on the processing of your personal data in writing. Information is frequently also available on the controllerâ€™s website, in their privacy policy or other page concerning data protection.

If you give your personal data directly to the controller, such as on a form, the controller is required to give you information on its processing immediately.

Controllers can also obtain your personal data from other sources than yourself. In such cases, they are usually required to inform you of its processing within one month.
