# Topic 10: Additional data controller responsibilities - informing of a data breach

&nbsp;

With the GDPR, a data controller has high responsibilities regarding data security. It must ensure that it has technical and managerial processes in place to ensure these and, in case of a personal data breach, must notify data subject within 72 hours about the incident.

&nbsp;

**Personal data breaches can include:**

- access by an unauthorised third party;
- deliberate or accidental action (or inaction) by a controller or processor;
- sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;
- computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;
- alteration of personal data without permission; and
- loss of availability of personal data.

&nbsp;

A personal data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal data. In short, there will be a personal data breach whenever any personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorisation; or if the data is made unavailable, for example, when it has been encrypted by ransomware, or accidentally lost or destroyed.
