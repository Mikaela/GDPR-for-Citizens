# Topic 7: Right of restricting the use of your data

&nbsp;

In certain cases, you can request the controller to restrict the processing of your personal data. Restriction means that the controller will only be permitted to process your personal data:

- with your consent
- for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
- in the public interest or
- in order to safeguard the rights of another person.

&nbsp;

You can restrict the processing of your personal data in the following situations:

- You consider the data to be inaccurate.
- Your data is being processed unlawfully, but you do not want them erased completely.
- The controller no longer needs your data for their original purpose, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
- You have objected to the processing of your personal data (requested that the controller not process them at all), but the final decision is still pending.

&nbsp;

If the controller restricts the processing of your data, it must communicate the restriction to all parties to whom the data have been disclosed in the past if viable. You can ask the controller to tell you the recipients of your data.

&nbsp;

**To restrict or object to the use of your data:**

- Contact the controller's data protection officer. 
- Use precise language in your request. 
- Specify your name and contact details. 
- Specify clearly the data and the justifications for the restriction or objection. If it is about direct marketing you do not need to specify a reason. 
- The controller must reply within a month but if the processing is complex they may use up to three months to send you your data. If the controller refuses to make this change, it must provide a valid legal reason for its refusal.

&nbsp;

If you feel that the controller did not have legal grounds for its refusal, you can contact the Data Protection Authority if necessary. To find the DPA of your country, search for: “ Data Protection Authority of _NAME_OF_YOUR_COUNTRY_HERE_ ”.
