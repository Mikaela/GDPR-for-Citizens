# Topic 7: Right of restricting the use of your data

&nbsp;

You have the right to restrict the use of your data if the controller no longer needs the data for the original purpose or if they are not processed lawfully but you still do not want them erased completely. You also have this right if you consider the data to be inaccurate or you have objected to the use of your information but the decision is still pending.

&nbsp;

It is also possible to object the processing on the grounds of your particular situation. Through this restriction, the controller will only be permitted to use your data with your consent, for legal purposes, in the public interest or in order to safeguard the rights of another person. If the individual asks the organisation to do so, the organisation needs to inform all the others of that restriction, that they have shared this data with. They also need to provide you with a list of those parties.

&nbsp;

**To restrict or object to the use of your data:**

- Contact the controller's data protection officer. 
- Use precise language in your request. 
- Specify your name and contact details. 
- Specify clearly the data and the justifications for the restriction or objection. If it is about direct marketing you do not need to specify a reason. 
- The controller must reply within a month but if the processing is complex they may use up to three months to send you your data. If the controller refuses to make this change, it must provide a valid legal reason for its refusal.
