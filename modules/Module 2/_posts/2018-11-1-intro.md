# Module 2: GDPR in a nutshell

&nbsp;

### Learning outcomes of the module

&nbsp;

By taking this module you will know the new rights gained with the GDPR and exercise them for your own benefit, for the lawfulness of your service providers and to be better able to protect your own personal data and its use.

&nbsp;

GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, that came into full force on the 26th of May, 2018, in the European Union. Knowing that these rights exist, is necessary to exercise them.

&nbsp;

**Essentially, you have the right to:**

- [know how your personal data is used](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/how-data-is-used/)
- [know if an organization is using your personal data and request for it](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/right-to-access/)
- [correct information about you](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/right-to-correct/)
- [ask for your data to be erased](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/right-to-delete/)
- [restrict or deny using some of your data](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/right-to-restrict/)
- [move your personal data to other services](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/data-portability/)
- [not to be subject to decisions made only by machines](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/deny-machines/)

&nbsp;

On top of these, the Data Controller can’t even store your personal data, if it doesn’t have one of the six lawful bases to process your data. We will go through these in the next module: **[Lawful bases to process](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/lawful-bases-to-process/).**
