# Topic 8: Right to move your personal data to other services (Data Portability)

&nbsp;

You have the right to move your data out of the service to use it elsewhere.

The personal data can only be transferred if:

- its processing was based on your consent or an agreement between yourself and the controller or
- it was processed automatically.

&nbsp;

The controller must deliver the data in a commonly used format. If it it feasible, the controller can also transmit your data directly to another service provider. If you want the data to be erased as well, you have to request it specifically.

&nbsp;

To move your data, contact the controller's data protection officer. Use precise language in your request.

- which data your request involves
- whether you would like the controller to deliver the data to you or transfer it directly to another controller
- your name and
- your contact details (such as your e-mail address or telephone number).

&nbsp;

The controller must reply within a month but if the processing is complex they may use up to three months to move your data. If the controller refuses to make this change, it must provide a valid legal reason in writing. If you feel that the controller did not have legal grounds for its refusal, you can [contact the Data Protection Authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en) if necessary.
