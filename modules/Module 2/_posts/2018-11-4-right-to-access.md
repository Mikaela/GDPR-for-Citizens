# Topic 4: Right to access your data

&nbsp;

You have the right to inspect and rectify the personal data a controller holds on you. The controller must provide it to you free of charge at least once per year, as long it’s not unreasonable.

&nbsp;

**You have the right to obtain information on the following matters from the controller:**

- the source from which your personal data was collected
- why your personal data is necessary for the intended processing
- for how long your personal data will be necessary
- whether your personal data has been disclosed or will be disclosed – and if yes, to whom
- whether your data has been transferred to outside the EU – and if yes, how has it been protected
- whether your data is being processed automatically – and if yes, how does the process function and
- how you can exercise your rights with regard to your personal data.

&nbsp;

You can receive this information on paper, electronically in a commonly used file format or verbally. Make the Subject Access Request  directly to the controller. Commonly known as a SAR. Additional information on the correct channels can usually be obtained from the controller’s website or customer service. To obtain this data, contact the controller's data protection officer, [like we do in Module 4](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%204/creating-your-sar/). 

&nbsp;

**Use precise language in your request:**

- which data you wish to inspect
- whether you wish to inspect all of your data or data from a certain period of time
- in what form you would like the data
- your name and
- your contact details (such as your e-mail address or telephone number).

&nbsp;

If the controller refuses to provide the information you have requested, it must state the reasons for its refusal. The refusal must always be based on law. If you feel that the controller did not have legal grounds for its refusal, you can [contact the Data Protection Authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm) in your country, if necessary.
