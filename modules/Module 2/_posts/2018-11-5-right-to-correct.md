# Topic 5: Right to correct data about you

&nbsp;

You have the right to demand the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. This is part of your legal protection that allows you to be evaluated on the basis of accurate data. This also includes the possibility to erase obsolete/unnecessary data and add data when necessary. The controller must provide it to you free of charge if it is a reasonable request. The controller must update all third parties who have your data and provide you with a list of them.

&nbsp;

To rectify this data, contact the controller's data protection officer, [like we do in module 4](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%204/creating-your-sar/). Use precise language in your request. Specify your name and contact details. Specify the data to be changed and the corrected version.

&nbsp;

### How to proceed

&nbsp;

Contact information on the correct channels can usually be obtained from the controller’s website or customer service.

In the request, specify:

- the data to be rectified, word for word
- the proposed changes, word for word
- the justifications for the changes proposed by you
- your name and
- your contact details (such as your e-mail address or telephone number).

&nbsp;

The controller is required to reply to your request within one month. If the requests are numerous or complex, the controller can reply that it needs more time to process them. If the controller announces that it needs more time for processing, the deadline for replying will be three months from your original request. Wait for the controller’s reply. Notifying you of a longer processing time does not mean that the controller will refuse to rectify the data.

&nbsp;

If the controller refuses to rectify the data you have requested, it must state the reasons for its refusal. The refusal must always be based on law. If you feel that the controller did not have legal grounds for its refusal, you can [contact the Data Protection Authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm) if necessary.
