# Topic 6 : Right for your data to be erased

&nbsp;

**You have the right to demand the erasure of your data if:**

- The controller no longer needs your data for their original purpose.
- You withdraw the consent you have given, and there is no other legal basis for processing your data.
- You object to object to the processing of your data, and there is no justifiable reason for the processing.
- You object to the processing of your data for purposes of direct marketing.
- Your data has been processed unlawfully.
- The law requires your data to be erased.
- Your data has been collected on the basis of your custodian’s consent in connection with the provision of information-society services. Information-society services include online shops and the social media, for example.

&nbsp;

**The controller will not be required to erase your personal data, however, if they are justifiably necessary for the following purposes::**

- the freedom of expression and information
- compliance with legislation
- the exercise of official authority vested in the controller
- public interest – such as archiving, research or the compilation of statistics or
- the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

&nbsp;

The controller must provide it to you free of charge if it is a reasonable request. The controller must request erasure to all third parties who have your data and provide you with a list of them.

To erase your data, contact the controller's data protection officer. Use precise language in your request. Specify your name and contact details. Specify clearly the data to be erased and the justifications for the erasure. The controller must reply within a month but if the processing is complex they may use up to three months to send you your data. If the controller refuses to make this change, it must provide a [valid legal reason](https://digirights.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/module%202/lawful-bases-to-process/).
