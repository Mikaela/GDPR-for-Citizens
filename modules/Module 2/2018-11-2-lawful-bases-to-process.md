# What are the lawful bases for processing?

&nbsp;

The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must apply whenever an organisation processes personal data:

&nbsp;

**(a) Consent:** the individual has given clear consent for the organisation to process their personal data for a specific purpose.
An example: You tick a box in a form, giving your consent to direct marketing, since you’re interested in that particular organisation’s products or services. Note that consent can’t be given with a sneaky pre-ticked box. That has been made explicitly clear in the GDPR.

&nbsp;

**(b) Contract:** the processing is necessary for a contract the organisation has with the individual, or because they have asked the organisation to take specific steps before entering into a contract.
An example: You’ve made a contract with a mobile operator to have a cellular service. The organisation needs to process some of your personal data to serve this contract, e.g. your phone number. They need to know your number to initiate the service.

&nbsp;

**(c) Legal obligation:** the processing is necessary for the organisation to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).
An example: The bank needs to know all its customers’ identities. They also need to save information of all your financial transactions for seven years in the UK, by law.

&nbsp;

**(d) Vital interests:** the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.
An example: An individual is admitted to the A & E department of a hospital with life-threatening injuries following a serious road accident. The disclosure to the hospital of the individual’s medical history is necessary in order to protect his/her vital interests.

&nbsp;

**(e) Public task:** the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.
An example: Private water companies are likely to be able to rely on the public task basis in most European countries. This is because they are considered to be carrying out functions of public administration and they exercise special legal powers to carry out utility services in the public interest.

&nbsp;

**(f) Legitimate interests:** the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)

&nbsp;

- An example: You make a pizza purchase online by submitting the delivery address to the pizza merchant. The merchant has legitimate interest in fulfilling the delivery, where the processing of the subject’s personal data (address) also passes the “necessary” requirement.

&nbsp;

_**However, an individual always has the right to object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing, whatever lawful basis applies.
