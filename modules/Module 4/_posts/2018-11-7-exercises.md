### Task 1:

&nbsp;

Make or plan to make your own SAR.
&nbsp;

Go through the process outlined in this module. Document your process in a A4 page or Youtube video and post it on the LifeLearn platform. If you get a reply to your SAR during the course, let fellow students know what happened. Weâ€™d appreciate a summary of your actions and a copy of the SAR itself, provided the personal information is scraped off first.

&nbsp;

### Task 2:

&nbsp;

- Feedback from making the SAR
- What was your overall feeling, was it easy, hard, boring, exciting or something else?
- What was hard/easy about it?
- What was surprising?
- Did you benefit from making the data request?
- Which company did you request your data from?
- Did they ask for additional information, e.g. passport identification, a physical visit or electronic identification?
- Did you get your data in time, did you have to correspond several times?
