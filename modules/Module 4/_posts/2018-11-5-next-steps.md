# What happens next?

&nbsp;

If you’ve done everything correctly (compare your data request with our template), you can expect to get an answer within 1 month. The provider can try to deny your request with cause. If this cause is not appropriate, i.e. based on the GDPR, then reply and raise a complaint with your country’s Data Protection Authority. They can also request up to an additional two months time depending on the situation. The requested data should be delivered within 3 months as a maximum .

Here’s a few possible scenarios that could happen after receiving your request. They are examples based on our own experiences, that we had in our events around the date the GDPR came into force.

### 1. Everything went well and you received all the information you requested

Great job! You have made a good data request and the organisation has been able to comply - it's all good!

&nbsp;

### 2. You’ve received information as per your request but feel it’s incomplete

&nbsp;

If they haven’t answered all your questions in your request, such as:

- listing for specific categories of data they have of you
- a list of all the third parties, they shared your data with
- how long are they storing your personal data for and asking how it may vary for different categories of your data
- whether they have collected personal data of you from third parties and who are those are
- whether they are making automated decisions about you, including profiling as well as specifics on their logic, significance and consequences of such processing of data
- or if the returned data is incomplete. You can see that there are gaps in the returned data set.

...you need to ask them again. They are actually bound to answer. It helps to specify what exactly you feel is missing.

&nbsp;

### 3. You’ve been asked for further details and actions, such as identifying yourself

&nbsp;

This is common in cases, where the organisation doesn’t have an electronic data portal that you might log into and prove your identity to their satisfaction. You might even be asked to go and identify yourself in person, but that is an unnecessary threshold you need not to comply with. They should to be able to confirm your identity through more convenient means. 

&nbsp;

For example, if they receive a data request from an email that is on their customer database, but the physical address you are asking them to send it to differs from theirs, it is reasonable for them to ask for proof of your new address. A recent utility bill should do the trick. The security measures taken in confirming your identity should be proportionate to the possible ramifications that would follow a possible data leak.

&nbsp;

You need to comply with their requests for additional information, as long as they are reasonable. If you feel the organisation’s demands are not, it might be a good idea to ask the data ombudsman (Data Protect Authority in your country) to clarify, whether the organisation’s request should be complied with. In case they’re not complying with your  requests, you should again contact the data ombudsman to see, if they think the organisation is right in refusing to comply.

&nbsp;

To find the DPA of your country, search for: 
"Data Protection Authority of NAME OF YOUR COUNTRY HERE”.

&nbsp;

### 4. You are not able to find out the contact information for who to send your request to

&nbsp;

You’ve scoured their website for contact details of their Data Protection Officer, but can’t find it in their data protection policy, privacy notice or anywhere else either. This is simply unacceptable. Try contacting their customer support and ask them, where can the data requests be sent. If you can’t find their contact details either, or they refuse to give you an address for the request, make a complaint to your data ombudsman, noting that because of lack of information, you can not exercise your rights.
