# Creating your SAR
&nbsp;

### Articulate your Subject Access Request (SAR)

Now you need to think what do you want to accomplish with your request. We’ve made an example Subject Access Request here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YXP6j1MJdWuDzpgxSlqArGcJ22kv_wYE6Kk0_Q4KvIM/edit?usp=sharing

There are a few good paragraphs we’ve picked for you to use, depending on what right you want to exercise. Instead of just using one of them, we encourage you to use a few of them or even all of them, if appropriate. As a rule, there’s no harm in asking.

In our letter, there is the address details of the relevant person or department complying with your request. You can try to find a self-service portal, the contact details of the Data Protection Officer (DPO), or other designated address to send your request to.

Usually, you can find the contact details in their privacy notice in their website. The link to it is usually located in the footer of the webpage and is usually called Privacy Policy, Privacy notice, Data Protection or something along those lines. If you can’t find it, it’s worth contacting their customer services and asking them for advice - they are required to help you, if their customers can’t find the details on their own.

Here are a few examples of websites and their footers (bottom of the web page), where the privacy policy and other necessary details for making a SAR are located.

### Choosing the right paragraphs for the SAR

After inserting the necessary contact details, we’ve introduced ourselves and expressed our knowledge of our rights and quoted the right articles for added effect.

After this, you can copy the paragraphs you want and we will now explain what effects each of them have:

1. Asking whether you personal data is being used? If so, ask for specific categories of data they have of you and request access to it

2. Request a list of all the third parties, they shared your data. In case they cannot, you’re asking them to guess.

3. Inquiring how long are they storing your personal data for and asking how it may vary for different categories of your data.

4. Asking if they have collected personal data of you from third parties and who are they

5. Wanting to know if they are making automated decisions about you, including profiling as well as specifics on their logic, significance and consequences of such processing of data

6. Ask which legal basis is used to process your data per category.

If you don’t want to copy and paste from our template, you can also try making your request in a data request platform, like the one Paul-Olivier Dehaye has setup: https://personaldata.io

Here’s a page from the Finnish Data Protection Authority’s website concerning your right to access your own data, for additional guidance: https://tietosuoja.fi/en/when-you-want-to-inspect-your-data

After you’ve written the SAR, you can send it to the relevant party, by post or by email.
