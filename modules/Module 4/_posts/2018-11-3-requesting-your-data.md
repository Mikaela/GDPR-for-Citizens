# Preparations for asking your personal data from an organisation
&nbsp;

### 1. Deciding which organisations have the most interesting data about you

Here’s a list of types of organisations, that might help you in finding out which of them would have the most interesting data of you. It’s not an exhaustive list and we’d be glad to add your favourite in it too.

### 2. Find out what information they might collect about you

Go to their web page and have a look at their privacy notice or policy on data protection, which is usually linked to at the bottom of the page. It should tell you, what kind of information they store about you. Generally, this information is not elaborated exhaustively. Thus, it is usually a good idea to ask for all of your personal data and you might find out information that you didn’t even know they had. Very possibly, they have data of you that they received from third parties, too.

&nbsp;

For example, here is a list of types of personal data Finnair has of its passengers:

### A privacy notice should always include at least these six items:

1. the personal data collected, including cookies on their website
2. how they process your data
3. third parties with whom the organisation has shared your data with
4. how people can access and request changes to their information
5. how the organisation notifies consumers of material changes to your privacy policy
6. the effective date of your privacy policy
