Here are a few cases we’ve processed and they might be helpful in giving you the idea of the kinds of data you will receive.

### 1. Best case scenario:

One of our participants made a request to KELA (The Finnish Social Insurance Institution or SII) and received 500 pages of double-sided printed A4 as an answer. He specifically requested to have them on paper.

Facebook and Google offer a data request platform, that you can receive your data through. (It’s not necessarily all the data of you that they have, however. You might have to ask for specifics through other means.)

### 2. Receiving incomplete data of you

Our participant made a data request to a mobile operator (Telia) and got very ambiguous details only about the contracts he had had with them. No customer service transactions, or any of the plethora of data mobile operators have of their customers. The supplied data hardly scratched the surface and he asked for all the data they had of him.

Another couple of people asked for their data from a retail chain’s loyalty program (K-Plussa) and the other person got lots of data on their profiling, whereas the other did not. We can be quite certain that the other person should’ve received these profiling details as well, but didn’t.

### 3. Encountering difficulties in making the data request

Like we’ve said, getting your data can be tricky. Here are some problems we’ve encountered so far. We would love to hear your experiences on your own data request, too! By collecting these experience together, we can navigate the process better and possibly avoid the most common problems altogether.

**No legal reason to comply**

This means that the organisation, the data controller, from which the person is requesting their data from, does not need to send you your personal data that you requested. However, they have to give the reasons of their refusal in writing and those reasons have to based on law. If you think that there were no legal grounds for the refusal you can contact your country’s Data Protection Authority for advice.

**Not finding contact details where to send the data request to**

Pinterest has some 200 million users, but they certainly weren’t GDPR compliant, when on 26.5. we tried to look for their Data Protection Officer’s contact details.

Here’s a little slideshow to show what kind information they had displayed: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yV28pSxD2EnA-AvWcpcoj2J6T3ZuZfEtHRcADLxrJV0/edit?usp=sharing>
